Simple development, following tutorials and other learning

* leaf1.html -- primary source is the first demo of leaflet:
  https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/ 

* tst_img.html -- how to load json-formatted data
  https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/

* tst_loader.html -- exploring several methods to load external data
  - borrowing from the learner/europrop maps (some of the page is 
    vestigal there) but manipulating some simple canvas elements.
