## Aims

* keep a quick reference guide to a handful of forecasting techniques
* show plots, including in forecast toolbox
* understand how to render R markdown in gh!

## Data

* Seasonal data example - australian beer production, from RJ Hyndman
  [fpp repo](https://github.com/robjhyndman/fpp2-package/tree/master/data/)

* less seasonal example - foreign visitors to oz. Same repo


educational open repo with gpl licence so I think no problems reuse. 

# Linkup commence.

A super simple forecast.
```{r}
library(forecast)
load("ausbeer.rda")
mod <- rwf(ausbeer, drift=TRUE)
autoplot(ausbeer) + autolayer(mod)


```
#sd(mod$residuals[-1])
And another.
```{r}
autoplot(ausbeer) + autolayer(snaive(ausbeer))

```
- combine them?
